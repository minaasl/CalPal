# CalPal

CalPal is a web-based application that allows users to track their daily calorie intake and monitor their progress towards their fitness goals. The application offers users the ability to create an account, set daily calorie goals, log meals and snacks, and track their progress over time.

The front-end of the application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be responsive and user-friendly. Users can easily navigate the application using the navigation bar at the top of the screen, which provides links to the main features of the application, including the dashboard, profile, and log out.

The main feature of CalPal is the calorie tracking tool, which allows users to log their meals and snacks throughout the day. Users can search for foods using the built-in search tool, which queries a database of common foods and their calorie counts. Once a user has selected a food item, they can enter the serving size and the application will calculate the total number of calories for that item.

The dashboard provides users with an overview of their daily calorie intake, including a breakdown of their calorie consumption by meal type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks). The dashboard also displays the user's progress towards their daily calorie goal, as well as their progress towards their long-term fitness goals.

The profile page allows users to update their account information, including their username, email address, and password. Users can also set their daily calorie goal on this page.

CalPal uses MongoDB as its backend database, and the application is built using Node.js and Express.js. The server-side code is responsible for handling user authentication, storing and retrieving user data from the database, and calculating calorie totals and progress towards fitness goals.

Overall, CalPal is a powerful tool for anyone looking to track their daily calorie intake and achieve their fitness goals. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, CalPal is the perfect tool for anyone looking to improve their health and wellness.
